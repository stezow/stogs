# First, name of the vdml file, the factory it is going to be set, then two string to quickly customize the a .map and .dmap files
# For .amap, sequence of volumename|matname|SDname|Color^volumename|matname|SDname|Color
# with color being r;g;b;alpha 
# For .dmap T means touchable i.e. change the name of the physical volume to include copy number
